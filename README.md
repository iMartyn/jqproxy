# jqproxy

Proxies json urls via jq (commandline must be installed)

Uses a very old jq go binding, but libjq is *STILL* waiting to be released.

No guarantees for production code quality here, this is used only for proxying predefined prometheus queries for IOT LED statuses.

Good Luck, Have Fun and if you don't like something, PRs will be reviewed, if you don't like the answer feel free to fork!
